Angular Node/Express MongoDB Project 🚀
Welcome to the Angular Node/Express MongoDB project! This project combines the power of Angular for the front end, Node/Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Follow the guide below to get started.

The aim of this project is to use Node/Express as the backend language, 
Angular Js as front end language and MongoDB as our database.

The backend server will connect to mongodb to save and fetch data to/from the database. 
Angular JS will be responsible for serving HTML and making get and post request to backend server.

Commands to run for the environment
    -npm install express
    -npm install fs-extra
    -npm install cors
    -npm install nodemon
    -npm install mongoose
    -npx nodemon <file-name>
