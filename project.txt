The aim of this project is to use Node/Express as the backend language, 
Angular Js as front end language and MongoDB as our database.

The backend server will connect to mongodb to save and fetch data to/from the database. 
Angular JS will be responsible for serving HTML and making get and post request to backend server.

You can create your own project that demonstrate these stacks.

Blog website

A blog post website that allows users to upload blogs or read blogs.

A home page with a form that asks for a blog details will be required. 
this form can ask questions like Blog title, Sub title, Blog body, Author etc. 
This information will then be send to the backend where a POST endpoint will accept it and save to database.

Another page to look for a blog by author name or title will be there upon selection of which
 a get request will URL parameter will be send to backend server which will 
 have a GET endpoint which will serve the blog content based on title or author name filter and 
 send back data to front end server. Front end server will then show the blog to user in a good UI format.
